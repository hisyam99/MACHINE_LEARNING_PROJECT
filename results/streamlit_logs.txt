Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Fast image processor class <class 'transformers.models.vit.image_processing_vit_fast.ViTImageProcessorFast'> is available for this model. Using slow image processor class. To use the fast image processor class set `use_fast=True`.

WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function TensorFlowTrainer.make_predict_function.<locals>.one_step_on_data_distributed at 0x7afdfd9391c0> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.

2025-12-16 13:39:12.652 Please replace `use_container_width` with `width`.

`use_container_width` will be removed after 2025-12-31.

For `use_container_width=True`, use `width='stretch'`. For `use_container_width=False`, use `width='content'`.
